# CS414-Linear-Regression

## Project Overview
This project implements a **Linear Regression** algorithm on a dataset containing at least 100 rows. The dataset includes two features for prediction (e.g., `MathScore` and `WritingScore`) and a target variable (`ReadingScore`). The script performs data preprocessing, scales the features, trains the model, and provides multiple outputs for evaluation, visualization, and analysis. 


## Requirements
The following Python libraries are required to run the script:
- `pandas`
- `os`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`

# How to Install

Install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
